Chapter 1: Acids and Bases

Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H⁺) in an aqueous solution. They have a sour taste and turn blue litmus paper red. Examples of common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), and nitric acid (HNO₃).

Bases are substances that release hydroxide ions (OH⁻) in solution. They have a bitter taste and slippery feel, and they turn red litmus paper blue. Examples include sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂).

The strength of an acid or base is determined by how completely it dissociates in water. Strong acids like HCl dissociate completely, while weak acids like acetic acid (CH₃COOH) do not.

The pH scale is used to measure the acidity or basicity of a solution. A pH less than 7 indicates an acid, greater than 7 indicates a base, and a pH of 7 is neutral.

Neutralization is a chemical reaction in which an acid reacts with a base to form salt and water. For example:

HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O

Chapter 2: Chemical Reactions

A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances (reactants) are converted into one or more new substances (products).

There are several types of chemical reactions:
1. Combination Reaction: Two or more substances combine to form a new substance.
   Example: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O

2. Decomposition Reaction: A single compound breaks down into two or more simpler substances.
   Example: 2HgO → 2Hg + O₂

3. Displacement Reaction: One element displaces another from a compound.
   Example: Zn + CuSO₄ → ZnSO₄ + Cu

4. Double Displacement Reaction: Exchange of ions between two compounds.
   Example: Na₂SO₄ + BaCl₂ → BaSO₄ + 2NaCl

5. Combustion Reaction: A substance reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light.
   Example: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O

Chemical equations must be balanced to follow the law of conservation of mass, which states that mass is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction.

Chapter 3: Metals and Non-Metals

Metals are elements that are generally solid, lustrous, malleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Examples include iron, copper, and aluminum.

Non-metals are elements that lack the properties of metals. They are generally poor conductors, brittle when solid, and have no metallic luster. Examples include sulfur, oxygen, and carbon.

When metals react with acids, they release hydrogen gas and form salts.
Example: Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂↑

Metals also form basic oxides, while non-metals form acidic oxides.
